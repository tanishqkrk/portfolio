I'm **Tanishq Kaushal**, a 22 year old self-taught **software engineer** based in New Delhi, India. While working professionally in companies like [Probooking](https://www.getprobooking.com/) and currently working at [Asymmetri](https://www.asymmetri.in/), I also like hacking together projects on the side. Currently working on [Lyrify](https://lyrify-beta.vercel.app/). My tech stack being **everything JavaScript** (TypeScript, NextJS, redux, all that cool stuff). And I'm currently learning Golang.

I also practice boxing, lift weights and go on jogs to keep up with my unhealthy caffeine habits. Oh! I like solving rubik's cubes, practicing math quizes and play Clash of Clans (I'm a Town hall 14).

Oh btw this theme and font is the same as my code editor :)
